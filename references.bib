              primarily premature infants that results from an imbalance
              between lung injury and repair in the developing lung. BPD is the
              most common respiratory morbidity in preterm infants, which
              affects nearly 10, 000 neonates each year in the United States.
              Over the last two decades, the incidence of BPD has largely been
              unchanged; however, the pathophysiology has changed with the
              substantial improvement in the respiratory management of
              extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. Here we have attempted
              to comprehensively review and summarize the current literature on
              the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of BPD. Our goal is to
              provide insight to help further progress in preventing and
              managing severe BPD in the ELBW infants.",

               cause of preterm birth. Chorioamnionitis can affect almost every
               organ of the developing fetus. Multiple microbes have been
               implicated to cause chorioamnionitis, but ``sterile''
               inflammation appears to be more common. Eradication of
               microorganisms has not been shown to prevent the morbidity and

               mediators account for continued fetal and maternal injury.
               Mounting evidence now supports the concept that the ensuing
               neonatal immune dysfunction reflects the effects of inflammation
               on immune programming during critical developmental windows,

               prolonged intubation. There is no consensus on the time of
               tracheotomy in neonates. Methods. We evaluated infants applied
               tracheotomy, time of procedure, and early complications in our
               neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) retrospectively from January
               2012 to December 2013. Results. We identified 9 infants applied
               tracheotomy with gestational ages 34 to 41 weeks. Their
               diagnoses were hypotonic infant, subglottic stenosis, laryngeal
               cleft, neck mass, and chronic lung disease. Age on tracheotomy
               ranged from 4 to 10 weeks. Early complication ratio was 33.3\%
               with minimal bleeding (1), air leak (1), and canal revision
               requirement (1). We discharged 7 infants, and 2 infants died in
               the NICU. Conclusion. Tracheotomy makes infant nursing easy for
               staff and families even at home. If carried out by a trained
               team, the procedure is safe and has low complication. When to
               apply tracheotomy should be individualized, and airway damage
               due to prolonged intubation versus risks of tracheotomy should
               be taken into consideration.",

  abstract = "The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is used to
              evaluate a biomarker's ability for classifying disease status.
              The Youden Index (J), the maximum potential effectiveness of a
              biomarker, is a common summary measure of the ROC curve. In
              biomarker development, levels may be unquantifiable below a limit
              of detection (LOD) and missing from the overall dataset.
              Disregarding these observations may negatively bias the ROC curve
              and thus J. Several correction methods have been suggested for
              mean estimation and testing; however, little has been written
              about the ROC curve or its summary measures. We adapt
              non-parametric (empirical) and semi-parametric (ROC-GLM
              [generalized linear model]) methods and propose parametric
              methods (maximum likelihood (ML)) to estimate J and the optimal
              cut-point (c *) for a biomarker affected by a LOD. We develop
              unbiased estimators of J and c * via ML for normally and gamma
              distributed biomarkers. Alpha level confidence intervals are
              proposed using delta and bootstrap methods for the ML,
              semi-parametric, and non-parametric approaches respectively.
              Simulation studies are conducted over a range of distributional
              scenarios and sample sizes evaluating estimators' bias, root-mean
              square error, and coverage probability; the average bias was less
              than one percent for ML and GLM methods across scenarios and
              decreases with increased sample size. An example using
              polychlorinated biphenyl levels to classify women with and
              without endometriosis illustrates the potential benefits of these
              methods. We address the limitations and usefulness of each method
              in order to give researchers guidance in constructing appropriate
              estimates of biomarkers' true discriminating capabilities.",

               regression equation using 80\% of the cohort. This equation was

               eligible patients, the mean gestational age was 26 weeks' and
               the median age at referral was 6.4 weeks. D/T occurred in 20\%
